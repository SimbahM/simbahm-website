					<span class="subhead">Problem</span>
					<div class="pagebody-text">
						<p class="pagebody">
							NMB Bank's existing mobile application presented
							inconsistencies in user experience and visual
							design, failing to fully align with the bank's
							established brand guidelines and strategic design
							goals. This resulted in a fragmented user journey
							across different platforms, hindering brand
							recognition and potentially impacting customer
							trust. Specifically, the lack of a unified design
							system across iOS and Android platforms created
							visual discrepancies and usability issues, leading
							to a disjointed user experience. Therefore, the core
							problem addressed in this redesign was the need to
							create a cohesive and brand-aligned mobile
							application that delivers a consistent and intuitive
							user experience across all platforms, effectively
							reinforcing NMB Bank's brand identity and enhancing
							customer engagement.

					<span class="subhead">Goals</span>
					<div class="pagebody-text">
						<p class="pagebody">
							In designing the mobile banking app, I prioritized a
							user-centered approach that meticulously balanced
							the bank's strategic business goals with the
							personal needs and aspirations of its users. This
							involved a deep understanding of both perspectives:
							for the bank, goals like increased customer
							engagement, reduced operational costs, and enhanced
							brand reputation were paramount. Simultaneously, I
							recognized that users sought convenience, security,
							and intuitive functionality that empowered them to
							manage their finances effectively.
						</p>
						<p class="pagebody">
							To achieve this balance, I employed a design process
							that integrated user research and stakeholder
							feedback at every stage. Wireframes and prototypes
							were iteratively refined, ensuring that each feature
							not only served a clear business objective but also
							addressed a specific user need. By focusing on
							creating a seamless and efficient user experience, I
							aimed to drive user adoption and engagement, which
							in turn contributed to the bank's overall success.
							This approach ensured that the final product was not
							only a functional tool but also a valuable asset
							that fostered a strong, mutually beneficial
							relationship between the bank and its customers.
