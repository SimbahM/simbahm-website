							>. Collaborating closely with the team, I
							contributed to defining, developing, and delivering

								To streamline the redesign of the Touchbase
								Technologies website, I used a mind map to
								organize ideas, and structure content.
							</p>
							<p class="pagebody">
								<strong
									>Starting with ‚ÄòWebsite Redesign‚Äô as the
									central node, I created primary branches for
									key areas like User Experience (UX), Visual
									Design, Content Strategy, and Brand
									Integration.</strong
								>
								Each branch expanded into subtopics‚Äîunder UX, I
								mapped out user flows, wireframes, and
								accessibility considerations, while the Visual
								Design branch focused on color schemes,
								typography, and imagery.
							</p>
							<p class="pagebody">
								The mind map helped me visualize the project
								holistically, identify gaps, and ensure a
								cohesive user journey. By sharing it during
								meetings, I was able to gather feedback, foster
								collaboration, and keep the project aligned with
								stakeholder expectations. This tool not only
								improved communication but also accelerated
								decision-making, allowing the team to see how
								each element connected to the larger vision.
